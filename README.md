## Risei
- _[Back](#choose-a-technology)_

**Risei** is a declarative testing framework for JavaScript that is robust, rich in features, and is itself well-tested.&nbsp;  It's a published **npm** package with an extensive read-me and its own descriptive website.&nbsp;  Please check it out!

- **Repo:**&nbsp;  [https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/risei](https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/risei)

- **Npm package site:**&nbsp;  [https://npmjs.com/package/risei](https://npmjs.com/package/risei)

## QuickBoard
- _[Back](#choose-a-technology)_

**QuickBoard** is a tool for use in Windows that saves reusable texts in small files, with each blurb of text copied to the clipboard with a single click, along with many powerful related features.&nbsp;  I use it every day when I'm working in Windows.

- **Repo:**&nbsp;  [https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/QuickBoard](https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/QuickBoard)

## Rewriter
- _[Back](#choose-a-technology)_

**Rewriter** is a tool that allows you to rewrite the contents of a file with a series of regular expressions.&nbsp;  It's very useful for well-planned transformations of code or other text-based material, or for turning shortcut syntax into full-form contents.&nbsp;  Both the file to change and the list of regular expressions can be dragged and dropped onto the UI.

- **Repo:**&nbsp; [https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/Rewriter](https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/Rewriter)

> ### Screenshot
> Here is the UI of Rewriter with a file to change and the regular expressions list already dropped on and ready to use.

## Native Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JS)
- _[Back](#choose-a-technology)_

### ___Coming soon!___

I have written many personal apps and tools with native web technologies, but they aren't ready to link here yet.&nbsp;  They will appear here later.



## React
- _[Back](#choose-a-technology)_

### ___Coming soon!___

I worked for a while with React, and created some pretty nice components and features using them, but they were proprietary code, so I don't have copies of them to show, or even screenshots.&nbsp;  Personal projects demonstrating my skills will appear here later.



## Angular
- _[Back](#choose-a-technology)_

### ___Coming soon!___

I worked for a little while with Angular, as well as making some personal projects with it.&nbsp;  All of it looked and worked great.&nbsp;  But they aren't ready to link yet.&nbsp;  Personal projects in Angular demonstrating my skills will appear here later.
