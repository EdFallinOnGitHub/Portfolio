# Portfolio : Ed Fallin

Hi there, thanks for checking out my portfolio!&nbsp;  Please take a look here and click through to whatever looks interesting.

I'm always happy to talk about these projects and how they demonstrate my skills, drive, and interests.&nbsp;  I hope you like them!

## Risei

**Risei** is a declarative testing framework for JavaScript that is robust, rich in features, and is itself well-tested.&nbsp;  It's a published **npm** package with an extensive read-me and its own descriptive website.&nbsp;  Check it out!

## QuickBoard

**QuickBoard** is a Windows tool that saves reusable texts in small files, with each blurb of text copied to the clipboard with a single click, along with many powerful related features.&nbsp;  I use it every day when I'm working in Windows.

## Rewriter

**Rewriter** is a Windows tool to rewrite the contents of a file with a series of regular expressions.&nbsp;  It's very useful for widespread changes to code or other text-based material.&nbsp;  Both the file to change and the list of regular expressions can be dragged and dropped onto the UI.

## Native Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JS)

I have written many personal apps and tools with native web technologies.&nbsp;  For now, just one of them is listed here.

### JobWave

**JobWave** is a tool website that I use to track jobs I have looked at online.&nbsp;  With it, I can transfer job listings from boards / websites, search for them among cached listings, sort and cache them, and copy them to the clipboard for long-term storage elsewhere.

> The version here is written in a procedural style, with all code in one JS file.&nbsp;  That was an expedient to make the tool usable on short notice.&nbsp;  Now I'm refactoring it and putting it under test &mdash; not yet included here.

- **Repo:**&nbsp;  [https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/JobWave](https://github.com/EdFallinOnGitHub/JobWave)

> ### Screenshots
> Here is the UI of Rewriter with a job listing transformed at the top (using the middle right-arrow button).&nbsp;  I can't claim the styling is gorgeous, but it's clear and distinguishes things clearly.

>
> And here an example of the flashes seen when any right-side button is clicked.&nbsp;  The flash fades in about a quarter-second.&nbsp;  Colors vary.&nbsp;  In this case, I clicked the down arrow in _Rearranger_.&nbsp;  I can claim this _is_ gorgeous.

> And here is the result when the job listing at the top has been found among the cached listings (after a flash).&nbsp;  You don't want to find a listing, so the result and flash are gold.&nbsp;  Again, this _is_ gorgeous.

> And if I want to make the browser window narrow, JobWave continues to be usable and look as good because I made it using responsive design.

## React

### ___Coming soon!___

I worked for a while with React, and created some pretty nice components and features that used them, but they were proprietary code.&nbsp;  As a result, I don't have a repo of them, or even screenshots.&nbsp;  Personal projects demonstrating my React skills will appear here later.

## Angular

### ___Coming soon!___

I worked for a little while with Angular, as well as making some personal projects with it.&nbsp;  All of it looked and worked great.&nbsp;  However, those projects not finished enough to link.&nbsp;  Personal projects demonstrating my Angular skills will appear here later.
