# Portfolio : Ed Fallin

##### Hi there, thanks for checking out my portfolio.&nbsp;  What you'll find here are descriptions of some of my projects and links to their existing repos elsewhere.&nbsp;  Please click through and take a look!


## Risei

**Risei** is a declarative testing framework for JavaScript that is robust, rich in features, and itself well-tested.&nbsp;  It's a published **npm** package with an extensive read-me, a fuller descriptive website, and a public repo for testing and reference.&nbsp;  Please check it out!

- **Npm package site:**&nbsp;  [https://npmjs.com/package/risei](https://npmjs.com/package/risei)

## QuickBoard

**QuickBoard** is a tool for use in Windows that saves reusable texts in small files, with each blurb of text copied to the clipboard with a single click, along with many powerful related features.&nbsp;  I use it every day when I'm working in Windows.

- **Reference repo:**&nbsp;  [ ]( )

> ### Screenshot
> Here is a board file opened in QuickBoard, with one or two items previously clicked and therefore colored green, which helps with some specialized use cases.

## Rewriter

**Rewriter** is a tool that allows you to rewrite the contents of a file with a series of regular expressions.&nbsp;  It's very useful for well-planned transformations of code or other text-based material, or for turning shortcut syntax into full-form contents.&nbsp;  Both the file to change and the list of regular expressions can be dragged and dropped onto the UI.
